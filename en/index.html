      Qworum — The Service Web
    </h1>
    <p>Qworum is:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        the world's first
        <strong>platform for distributed Web applications</strong>.
        Qworum defines a module system for Web applications, where modules may be located anywhere on the Web.
        In other words, Qworum is a <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/micro-frontends.html" target="_blank">micro-frontend</a> platform
        that works at Web scale.
      </li>
      <li>
        an
        <strong>
          advanced Web browser feature 
        </strong>
        that websites can use.
      </li>
      <li>
        a
        <strong>
          Web browser extension
        </strong>.
      </li>
      <li>
        a technology that radically
        <strong>
          improves
          Web developer productivity
        </strong>
        through modularity and third-party full-page interactive services. Build your Web application by mixing and matching remote or local services and cut development time.
      </li>
      <!-- <li>
        <strong>
          the world's first distributed Web API technology,
        </strong>
        complementing JSON-RPC, XML-RPC, gRPC, SOAP, REST.
        Qworum APIs can interact with the end-user, and calls can consist of more than one request-response pair.
      </li> -->
      <li>
        the <em>Service Web</em> that complements
        the HTML-based <em>Document Web</em> and
        the RDF-based <em>Semantic Web</em>.
      </li>
      <li>
        an upgrade to the World Wide Web to make it provide better support for Web applications. This is needed because
        the Web was initially conceived as a medium for content, not applications.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Qworum defines:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        a new top-level Web format called <dfn>the Qworum script</dfn>. These contain executable code rather than content as HTML does.
        Web browsers can receive Qworum scripts from Web servers in an XML document. Web pages can also generate Qworum scripts using JavaScript.
      </li>
      <li>
        an interpreter for Qworum scripts. This client-side software can be implemented by Web browsers natively or as a browser extension.
      </li>
      <li>
        a new client-side storage for storing the execution state of each browser tab. This storage can use IndexedDB behind the scenes.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <!-- <p>Qworum is used for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>application integration</strong>. Web applications can offer Qworum services to other Web applications.</li>
      <li>enhancing <strong>developer productivity</strong>. Applications can use Qworum services remotely without having to implement them themselves.</li>
      <li>improving the <strong> user experience</strong>. Qworum applications can offer dynamic user experiences more easily than other Web applications, because Qworum services can easily be combined to offer dynamic user flows.</li>
    </ul> -->

    <p>
      Qworum is suitable for all Web application frontends, from Jamstack-style static frontends that are executed on the client to traditional dynamic frontends that are generated on the server for each user.

      <h2>Specification</h2>
      <p>
        You can either directly <a href="specification/v1/">jump to the Qworum specification</a>,
        or first read the following in order to get some context about what Qworum is trying to achieve.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="context">
      <h2>A platform for distributed web applications</h2>
      <p>
        There are currently two different Webs that exist on the World Wide Web:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The <dfn>Document Web</dfn>:
          This the Web that most Web developers will be familiar with.
          The primary type of content is the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML"
            target="_blank">HTML page</a>, and the primary content consumers are human users rather than machines.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <dfn>Semantic Web</dfn>:
          This the Web that is intended for machine consumption rather than human consumption.
          The primary type of content is <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/data" target="_blank">RDF</a>
          and its various encodings such as JSON-LD and Turtle.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Qworum adds another type of Web to the mix: the <dfn>Service Web</dfn>. Qworum is used for providing software
        rather than content. Qworum services are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Interactive</strong>: They can interact with end-users through HTML pages.</li>
        <li><strong>Composable</strong>: They can call other Qworum services, and even themselves. And Qworum services
          can return data to their callers. A <dfn>Qworum application</dfn>, on the other hand, is simply a Qworum
          service that does not have a caller.</li>
      </ul>
      <figure>
        <img src="the-three-webs.svg" style="width: 1000px" alt="The three Webs">
        <figcaption>1: The three Webs</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Note that although Qworum is distinct from the two previous Webs, it builds on them:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>User interaction occurs through HTML pages. End-users will barely notice that they are using Qworum rather
          than the Document Web.</li>
        <li>Qworum services can return semantic data to their callers, in addition to conventional data such as
          XML-wrapped JSON or any other XML data.</li>
      </ul>
      <figure>
        <img src="user-flow.png" style="width: 400px" alt="User flow">
        <figcaption>2: The user flow when a Qworum application or service calls another Qworum service</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </section>

    <section id="use-cases">
      <h2>Use cases</h2>
      <p>The main use cases for Qworum are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Application integration</strong>: Different Web-based applications can provide Qworum services to
          each other and provide a seamless user experience that combines both applications.</li>
        <li><strong>Productivity gains when developing web applications</strong>: An interactive service needs to be
          implemented and made available on the Web only once. All Web applications can then leverage that service and
          spare countless development hours.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Qworum is widely applicable. If an online service is interactive, then it can benefit from using Qworum. Here is
        a foretaste of the types of services that Qworum can enable:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>User authentication</li>
        <li>Payment processing</li>
        <li>Collection management — shopping cart, addressbook/contacts, movies, files, customer information, supplier
          information, …</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You may ask yourself: "Web applications can already use third-party services through remote API calls, how is
        Qworum better?".
        The answer is that currently third-party services can only provide business logic through their APIs (whether
        they are REST-based or not), whereas Qworum services can also bring the UI that goes along with the business
        logic. This lightens the workload of Web application developers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then you may ask yourself: "But aren't OpenID Connect-based services also interactive?". Indeed they are, but
        OpenID Connect is only applicable to a particular problem domain, whereas Qworum's interactivity concept applies
        to all Web-based services.

    <section id="demo">
      <h2>Demo</h2>
      <p>
        This <a href="/Qworum-demo-alpha.mp4">video demo</a> shows a Qworum application calling a third-party Qworum
        service, which in turn calls another Qworum service. Demo status: alpha.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that with Qworum the user experience remains the same as with the current Web.

    <section id="deliverables">
      <h2>Deliverables</h2>
      <p>
        Deliverables that are in late-alpha / pre-beta stage:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The <a href="specification/v1.0/index.html">Qworum Specification</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Browser extension</strong>: Only Google Chrome is supported at this time, although adding support
          for all major browsers is on our roadmap.</li>
        <li><strong>Client library in JavaScript</strong>: This library is intended for use in the Web pages of Qworum
          applications and services. ⚠️ For this library to work correctly, your website's origin must be explicitly
          supported by the Qworum browser extension. This is because this library communicates with the Qworum
          extension.
          <!-- If you DM us your Web origin on Twitter, we can activate Qworum for your website. Note that you do not need to DM us for developing Qworum applications and services on your local machine. -->
        </li>
        <li><strong>Server library in JavaScript</strong>: Suitable for Node.js (and also Deno) applications. Used for
          sending dynamic <a href="specification/v1.0/#script">Qworum scripts</a> to clients, and for parsing <a
            href="specification/v1.0/#phase-parameters">phase parameters</a> received from clients.</li>
        <li><strong>Server library in TypeScript</strong>: Suitable for Deno applications. Used for sending dynamic
          Qworum scripts to clients, and for parsing phase parameters received from clients.</li>
        <li><strong>Visual Studio Code extension</strong>: Provides XML snippets for writing static Qworum scripts. This
          VS Code extension is automatically activated for files that have the <code>.qrm.xml</code> extension.</li>
        <li><strong>Demo</strong>: Qworum application (e-commerce site) & 2 Qworum services (shopping cart, payment
          gateway).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Other planned deliverables:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Chrome DevTools extension</strong>: For debugging Qworum applications and services.</li>
        <li><strong>Netlify build plugin</strong>: Aims to ensure that Qworum applications and services will run without
          runtime errors. It does this by checking that the required Qworum resources are available for the website to
          use.</li>
        <!-- <li><strong>Marketplace for Qworum services:</strong> For listing, selling and purchasing Qworum services.</li> -->
      </ul>
