      <h2>Specification</h2>
      <p>
        You can either directly <a href="specification/v2.0/">jump to the Qworum specification</a>, 
        or first read the following in order to get some context about what Qworum is trying to achieve.

    <section id="context">
      <h2>A platform for distributed web applications</h2>
      <p>
        There are currently two different Webs that exist on the World Wide Web:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The <dfn>Document Web</dfn>: 
          This the Web that most Web developers will be familiar with. 
          The primary type of content is the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML" target="_blank">HTML page</a>, and the primary content consumers are human users rather than machines. 
        </li>
        <li>
          The <dfn>Linked-data Web</dfn>: 
          This the Web that is intended for machine consumption rather than human consumption. 
          The primary type of content is <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/data" target="_blank">RDF</a> and its various encodings such as JSON-LD, Turtle and N3.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Qworum adds another type of Web to the mix: the <dfn>Service Web</dfn>. Qworum is used for providing software rather than content. Qworum services are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Interactive</strong>: They can interact with end-users through HTML pages.</li>
        <li><strong>Composable</strong>: They can call other Qworum services, and even themselves. And Qworum services can return data to their callers. A <dfn>Qworum application</dfn>, on the other hand, is simply a Qworum service that does not have a caller.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Note that although Qworum is distinct from the two previous Webs, it builds on them:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>User interaction occurs through HTML pages. End-users will barely notice that they are using Qworum rather than the Document Web.</li>
        <li>Qworum services can return linked-data to their callers (but they can also return conventional data such as XML-wrapped JSON, or any other XML data).</li>
      </ul>
      <figure>
        <img src="index.svg" alt="Phase">
        <figcaption>1: The three Webs</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </section>

    <section id="use-cases">
      <h2>Use cases</h2>
      <p>The main use cases for Qworum are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Application integration</strong>: Different Web-based applications can provide Qworum services to each other and provide a seamless user experience that combines both applications.</li>
        <li><strong>Productivity gains when developing web applications</strong>: An interactive service needs to be implemented and made available on the Web only once. All Web applications can then leverage that service and spare countless development hours.</li>
      </ul>
      <figure>
        <img src="use-case.svg" alt="Phase">
        <figcaption>2: Example of a Qworum application that depends on a Qworum service, which in turn depends on another Qworum service</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        You may ask yourself: "But Web applications can already use third-party services through remote API calls, so why is Qworum better?"
      </p>
      <p>
        The answer is that currently third-party services can only provide business logic through their APIs (whether they are REST-based or not), whereas Qworum services can also bring the UI that goes along with the business logic. This lightens the workload of Web application developers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then you may ask yourself: "But aren't OpenID Connect-based services also interactive?". Indeed they are, but OpenID Connect is only applicable to a particular problem domain, whereas Qworum's interactivity concept applies to all Web-based services.

    <section id="deliverables">
      <h2>Deliverables</h2>
      <p>
        The status of all deliverables is late-alpha / pre-beta. 
        Everything is already useable to a great extent, but none of the software is published yet.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The <a href="specification/v2.0/index.html">Qworum Specification</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Browser extension</strong>: Only Google Chrome is supported at this time, although adding support for all major browsers is on our roadmap.</li>
        <li><strong>Client library in JavaScript</strong>: This library is intended for use in the Web pages of Qworum applications and services. ⚠️ For this library to work correctly, your website's origin must be explicitly supported by the Qworum browser extension. This is because this library communicates with the Qworum extension. If you DM us your Web origin on Twitter, we can activate Qworum for your website. Note that you do not need to DM us for developing Qworum applications and services on your local machine.</li>
        <li><strong>Server library in JavaScript</strong>: Suitable for Node.js (and also Deno) applications. Used for sending dynamic <a href="specification/v2.0/#script">Qworum scripts</a> to clients, and for parsing <a href="specification/v2.0/#phase-parameters">phase parameters</a> received from clients.</li>
        <li><strong>Server library in TypeScript</strong>: Suitable for Deno applications. Used for sending dynamic Qworum scripts to clients, and for parsing phase parameters received from clients.</li>
        <li><strong>Visual Studio Code extension</strong>: Provides XML snippets for writing static Qworum scripts. This VS Code extension is automatically activated for files that have the <code>.qrm.xml</code> extension.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="todo">
      <h2>To do</h2>
      <p>
        To do in the near to medium term:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>In the Qworum specification, the domain of the Qworum namespaces will change from qworum.com to qworum.net.</li>
        <li>JamStack support: Currently, Qworum services and applications are required to send dynamic Qworum scripts from servers to browsers. This means that a website's front-end cannot be wholly served to end-users through CDNs.
          In order for Qworum services and applications to be CDN-friendly, the Qworum client library will have to be able to generate Qworum scripts on the client.
        </li>
        <li>
          The default type for <code><a href="specification/v2.0/#linked-data">linked-data</a></code>
          should probably be JSON-LD rather than Turtle.
        </li>
        <li>
          Client libraries for <dfn>opaque service calls</dfn>, which are service calls that execute without an end-user that services can interact with through HTML pages. Although opaque calls are not interactive, they still provide a high degree of composability without increasing the risk of network timeouts, which other API technologies do not provide.
        </li>
      </ul>
