        Qworum is the Service Web that enables modular and distributed Web applications. Qworum is suitable for both enterprise and consumer software.
      </p>

      <p>
        Qworum is a deep-tech invention in the microservices realm.
        Depending on the problem you are trying to solve,
        Qworum can be described as:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          the world's first and only <strong>module system for Web applications</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          a distributed Web application technology.
        </li>
        <li>
          a platform for
          interactive <a href="https://microservices.io" target="_blank">microservices</a>;
          Qworum solves the "UI-monolith problem" for microservice architectures through
          microservices which contain their own full-page UIs.
        </li>
        <!-- <li>
          <strong>
            the world's first distributed Web API technology,
          </strong>
          complementing JSON-RPC, XML-RPC, gRPC, SOAP, REST.
          Qworum APIs can interact with the end-user, and calls can consist of more than one request-response pair.
        </li> -->
        <li>
          the <em>Service Web</em> that complements
          the HTML-based <em>Document Web</em> and
          the RDF-based <em>Semantic Web</em>.
        </li>
        <!-- <li>
          an upgrade to the World Wide Web that improves application support.
        </li>
        <li>
          an
          advanced Web browser feature
          that websites can use.
        </li> -->
      </ul>

      <p>
        Qworum is suitable for both of these frontend types:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://jamstack.org/" target="_blank">Jamstack</a>
          frontends that consist of static files.
        </li>
        <li>
          frontends that are dynamically generated server-side for each user.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>1. Specification</h2>
      <p>
        You can either directly jump to the <a href="specification/v1/">Qworum specification</a>,
        or first read the following in order to get some context about what Qworum is trying to achieve.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="ui-bottleneck">
      <h2>2. Solving the UI-monolith bottleneck for microservice architectures</h2>
      <h3>2.1. What are microservice architectures?</h3>
      <p>
        Microservice architectures enable rapid software delivery by allowing different parts of a software system to be developed, deployed and updated in parallel by different teams within an organization and also across organizations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Microservice architectures organise developer teams around vertical slices of software systems rather than the horizontal UI, business logic, and data layers. In order words, microservice teams are responsible for all of these 3 layers within the boundaries of a particular slice.
      </p>

      <h3>2.2. What is wrong with monolithic user interfaces?</h3>
      <p>
        One problem that was unsolved until Qworum is the <em id="ui-monolith">UI monolith</em> issue for microservice architectures. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Indeed, without Qworum current microservice architectures are unable to slice the UI layer into microservices completely. Web applications still must have a monolithic component at the UI layer. This monolithic component acts as a container for the different  <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/micro-frontends.html"
        target="_blank">micro-frontends</a> which constitute parts of the monolith's web pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having a monolithic component at the UI layer represents a bottleneck for the software development and delivery processes, because the team responsible for the UI monolith cannot scale with the number of microservices.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, existing microfrontend-based solutions are frequently only usable within a particular context rather than being universally applicable. This limiting context can be:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          a particular organization, which precludes cross-organization applications.
        </li>
        <li>
          a particular web application.
        </li>
        <li>
          a particular frontend framework such as React.js or Angular.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Also, the data exchange mechanism between a micro-frontend and its caller, which is generally a UI monolith, is ad hoc at best. 
        For example, if a micro-frontend is implemented as a React.js component, then the micro-frontend can use React.js's built-in mechanism for receiving data from its caller.
        On the other hand, how and if a React.js component can return a result to its caller is an implementation detail
        that needs to be resolved on a case by case basis.
      </p>

      <h3>2.3. The Qworum solution</h3>
      <p>
        The <em id="interactive-service">interactive service</em> concept defined by Qworum solves all above-mentioned issues:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Qworum is a web-scale microservices platform that is usable both within organizations and across organizations.
        </li>
        <li>
          Qworum is independent from any particular application.
        </li>
        <li>
          Qworum is independent from any particular web framework.
        </li>
        <li>
          Qworum defines a general data exhange mechanism for exchanging data between Qworum services and their callers. This obviates the need for developing data exchange solutions that are specific to a given application or organization.
        </li>
      </ul>

        <figcaption>2.1.1: From UI monolith to interactive microservices</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Qworum is also solving the <em id="nesting">nesting</em> issue that the current microfrontend solutions are facing. Indeed, microfrontends often cannot contain other microfrontends because the screen area allocated to nested elements quickly becomes vanishingly small.
      </p>
      <p>
        In contrast, the nesting depth of Qworum services is unbounded, because Qworum allocates a full web page to each Qworum service regardless of the nesting depth.

    <section id="platform">
      <h2>3. A platform for distributed web applications</h2>
      <p>
        There are currently two different Webs that exist on the World Wide Web:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The <dfn>Document Web</dfn>:
          This the Web that most Web developers will be familiar with.
          The primary type of content is the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML"
            target="_blank">HTML page</a>, and the primary content consumers are human users rather than machines.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <dfn>Semantic Web</dfn>:
          This the Web that is intended for machine consumption rather than human consumption.
          The primary type of content is <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/data" target="_blank">RDF</a>
          and its various encodings such as JSON-LD and Turtle.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Qworum adds another type of Web to the mix: the <dfn>Service Web</dfn>. Qworum is used for providing software
        rather than content. Qworum services are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Interactive</strong>: They can interact with end-users through HTML pages.</li>
        <li><strong>Composable</strong>: They can call other Qworum services, and even themselves. And Qworum services
          can return data to their callers. A <dfn>Qworum application</dfn>, on the other hand, is simply a Qworum
          service that does not have a caller.</li>
      </ul>
      <figure>
        <img src="the-three-webs.svg" alt="The three Webs">
        <figcaption>1: The three Webs</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Note that although Qworum is distinct from the two previous Webs, it builds on them:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>User interaction occurs through HTML pages. End-users will barely notice that they are using Qworum rather
          than the Document Web.</li>
        <li>Qworum services can return semantic data to their callers, in addition to conventional data such as
          XML-wrapped JSON or any other XML data.</li>

    <section id="demo">
      <h2>4. Demonstration — application spanning several DNS domains</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="/_assets/video/Qworum-demo-online-shop.mp4" target="_blank">This video</a> 
        shows an online shop calling a remote shopping cart service. 
      </p>
      <p>
        See this demo live at <a href="https://shop.demo.qworum.net" target="_blank">shop.demo.qworum.net</a>. 
        Be sure to <a href="#downloads">install</a> the Qworum extension for your desktop browser beforehand.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this demonstration, the e-shop is a Qworum application and the shopping cart is a remote Qworum service.
        Thanks to Qworum, the shopping cart service integrates with the e-shop seamlessly, despite being hosted on another DNS domain. (The e-shop is hosted on <code>shop.demo.qworum.net</code> while the shopping cart is hosted on <code>cart.demo.qworum.net</code>)

        Note that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          with Qworum the user experience is similar to the current Web, with the exception that the browser's back button will be disabled.
        </li>
        <li>
          search engines can't peek inside Qworum services, so if search engine optimization (SEO) is important for you then you might want to carefully consider which parts of your application will be implemented as Qworum services. For enterprise and business applications SEO is generally not an issue, but consumer applications such as an online shop might want to only use remote Qworum services and limit the use of internal Qworum services to the parts that should remain out of reach for search engines.

      <h2>5. A secure computing environment</h2>
      <p>
        The Qworum platform conforms to the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy" target="_blank">same-origin policy</a> that is the prevalent security mechanism for browser standards. In particular
        all phases of a given Qworum object are contained in the object's web origin. This ensures that data belonging to one web origin is unable to accidentally leak to another origin.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="use-cases">
      <h2>6. Use cases</h2>
      <p>The main use cases for Qworum are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Application integration</strong>: Different Web-based applications can provide Qworum services to
          each other and provide a seamless user experience that combines both applications.</li>
        <li><strong>Productivity gains when developing web applications</strong>: An interactive service needs to be
          implemented and made available on the Web only once. All Web applications can then leverage that service and
          spare countless development hours.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Qworum is widely applicable. If an online service is interactive, then it can benefit from using Qworum. Here is
        a foretaste of the types of services that Qworum can enable:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>User authentication</li>
        <li>Payment processing</li>
        <li>Collection management — shopping cart, addressbook/contacts, movies, files, customer information, supplier
          information, …</li>
      </ul>
