      Qworum — The Service Web
    </h1>
    <p>Qworum is:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        a <strong>module system for Web applications</strong>, where modules may be located anywhere on the Web.
      </li>
      <li>
        a distributed Web application technology.
      </li>
      <li>
        a platform for
        interactive <a href="https://microservices.io" target="_blank">microservices</a>;
        these are microservices that bring their own <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/micro-frontends.html"
          target="_blank">micro-frontends</a>.
      </li>
      <!-- <li>
        <strong>
          the world's first distributed Web API technology,
        </strong>
        complementing JSON-RPC, XML-RPC, gRPC, SOAP, REST.
        Qworum APIs can interact with the end-user, and calls can consist of more than one request-response pair.
      </li> -->
      <li>
        the <em>Service Web</em> that complements
        the HTML-based <em>Document Web</em> and
        the RDF-based <em>Semantic Web</em>.
      </li>
      <li>
        an upgrade to the World Wide Web for improved application support.
      </li>
      <li>
        an
        advanced Web browser feature
        that websites can use.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Qworum defines:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        a new top-level Web format called <dfn>the Qworum script</dfn>. These contain executable code rather than
        content as HTML does.
        Web browsers can receive Qworum scripts from Web servers in an XML document. Web pages can also generate Qworum
        scripts using JavaScript.
      </li>
      <li>
        an interpreter for Qworum scripts. This client-side software can be implemented by Web browsers natively or as a
        browser extension.
      </li>
      <li>
        a new client-side storage for storing the execution state of each browser tab. This storage can use IndexedDB
        behind the scenes.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Qworum is suitable for both:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://jamstack.org/" target="_blank">Jamstack</a>
        frontends that are made up of static files, and
      </li>
      <li>
        the more legacy Web frontends that are dynamically generated on the server for each user.
      </li>
    </ul>

        shows an online shop calling a remote shopping cart service.

      </p>
      <p>
        This sample e-shop is a Qworum application and the shopping cart is a remote Qworum service.
        A payment processing service will be implemented later on. Demo status: alpha.

        Note that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          with Qworum the user experience is similar to the current Web, with the exception that the browser's back button will be disabled.
        </li>
        <li>
          search engines can't peek inside Qworum services, so if search engine optimization (SEO) is important for you then you might want to carefully consider which parts of your application will be implemented as Qworum services. For enterprise and business applications SEO is generally not an issue, but consumer applications such as an online shop might want to only use remote Qworum services and limit the use of internal Qworum services to the parts that should remain out of reach for search engines.

    <section id="context">
      <h2>A platform for distributed web applications</h2>
      <p>
        There are currently two different Webs that exist on the World Wide Web:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The <dfn>Document Web</dfn>:
          This the Web that most Web developers will be familiar with.
          The primary type of content is the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML"
            target="_blank">HTML page</a>, and the primary content consumers are human users rather than machines.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <dfn>Semantic Web</dfn>:
          This the Web that is intended for machine consumption rather than human consumption.
          The primary type of content is <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/data" target="_blank">RDF</a>
          and its various encodings such as JSON-LD and Turtle.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Qworum adds another type of Web to the mix: the <dfn>Service Web</dfn>. Qworum is used for providing software
        rather than content. Qworum services are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Interactive</strong>: They can interact with end-users through HTML pages.</li>
        <li><strong>Composable</strong>: They can call other Qworum services, and even themselves. And Qworum services
          can return data to their callers. A <dfn>Qworum application</dfn>, on the other hand, is simply a Qworum
          service that does not have a caller.</li>
      </ul>
      <figure>
        <img src="the-three-webs.svg" style="width: 700px" alt="The three Webs">
        <figcaption>1: The three Webs</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Note that although Qworum is distinct from the two previous Webs, it builds on them:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>User interaction occurs through HTML pages. End-users will barely notice that they are using Qworum rather
          than the Document Web.</li>
        <li>Qworum services can return semantic data to their callers, in addition to conventional data such as
          XML-wrapped JSON or any other XML data.</li>
      </ul>
      <figure>
        <img src="user-flow.png" style="width: 400px; height: auto;" alt="User flow">
        <figcaption>2: The user flow when a Qworum application or service calls another Qworum service</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </section>

    <section id="use-cases">
      <h2>Use cases</h2>
      <p>The main use cases for Qworum are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Application integration</strong>: Different Web-based applications can provide Qworum services to
          each other and provide a seamless user experience that combines both applications.</li>
        <li><strong>Productivity gains when developing web applications</strong>: An interactive service needs to be
          implemented and made available on the Web only once. All Web applications can then leverage that service and
          spare countless development hours.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Qworum is widely applicable. If an online service is interactive, then it can benefit from using Qworum. Here is
        a foretaste of the types of services that Qworum can enable:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>User authentication</li>
        <li>Payment processing</li>
        <li>Collection management — shopping cart, addressbook/contacts, movies, files, customer information, supplier
          information, …</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You may ask yourself: "Web applications can already use third-party services through remote API calls, how is
        Qworum better?".
        The answer is that currently third-party services can only provide business logic through their APIs (whether
        they are REST-based or not), whereas Qworum services can also bring the UI that goes along with the business
        logic. This lightens the workload of Web application developers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then you may ask yourself: "But aren't OpenID Connect-based services also interactive?". Indeed they are, but
        OpenID Connect is only applicable to a particular problem domain, whereas Qworum's interactivity concept applies
        to all Web-based services.
