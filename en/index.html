      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="#platform">Qworum is a foundational Web technology</a> that makes Web-based user interfaces fully compatible with microservices architectures.
      </p>
      <p>
        To this end
        Qworum defines a new type of microservice / Web API: the Qworum service. Qworum services are interactive
        microservices that serve as building blocks for modular and distributed Web applications.
        Qworum's browser technology is implemented by the <a href="#downloads">Qworum browser extension</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        While micro frontends are also used for the same purpose of breaking Web UIs into manageable pieces, 
        Qworum offers a complementary approach with features that cannot be matched by micro frontends.
        Here is a brief comparison (see below for a more <a href="#ui-bottleneck"> detailed comparison with micro frontends</a>):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Qworum enables <strong class="usp">unbounded composability and cross-organisational applicability</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Whereas the UIs of micro frontends can only occupy a predefined display area within a web page,
          Qworum services can use a sequence of full-page UIs for interacting with the end-user.
        </li>
        <li>
          Whereas micro frontends are Web page parts that are implemented with existing Web technologies, Qworum defines an entirely novel foundational Web technology and Web browser capability targeting microservices architectures specifically.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. Solving the UI-monolith bottleneck for microservices architectures</h2>

      <section>
        <h3>2.1. What are microservices architectures?</h3>
        <p>
          Microservices architectures enable rapid software delivery by allowing different parts of a software system to
          be developed, deployed and updated in parallel by different teams within an organization and also across
          organizations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Microservices architectures organise developer teams around vertical slices of software systems rather than the
          horizontal UI, business logic, and data layers. In order words, microservice teams are responsible for all of
          these 3 layers within the boundaries of a particular slice.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>2.2. What is wrong with monolithic user interfaces?</h3>
        <!-- <p>
          One problem that was unsolved until Qworum is the <em id="ui-monolith">UI monolith</em> issue for microservices architectures. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Indeed, without Qworum current microservices architectures are unable to slice the UI layer into microservices completely. Web applications still must have a monolithic component at the UI layer. This monolithic component acts as a container for the different  <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/micro frontends.html"
          target="_blank">micro frontends</a> which constitute parts of the monolith's web pages.
        </p> -->
        <p>
          For microservices architectures,
          having a monolithic component at the UI layer represents a bottleneck for the software development lifecycle,
          because the team responsible for the UI monolith cannot scale with the number of microservices.
        </p>

        <h3>2.3. Are micro frontends the right solution?</h3>
        <p>
          Today, the only solution that software developers have at their disposal for breaking UI monoliths into
          smaller parts involves micro frontends.
        </p>
        <p>
          Micro frontends are UI components that are plugged into dashboard-style web pages for building web
          applications. In this case web applications become simple containers for micro frontends.
        </p>
        <p>
          Micro frontends are implemented using various technologies such as <a
            href="https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html" target="_blank">React.js components</a>, <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components" target="_blank">web components</a> or <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe" target="_blank">iframes</a>, none of
          which are specific to microservices architectures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides being only suitable for dashboard-style applications, other limiting factors for micro frontends
          include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>Bounding context —</em>
            Micro-frontend solutions are typically only usable within a particular context rather than being universally
            applicable. This limiting context can be
            a particular organization (which precludes cross-organization applications),
            a particular web application, or
            a particular frontend framework such as React.js or Angular for example.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Data exchange —</em>
            The data exchange mechanism between a micro-frontend and its container is ad hoc at best.
            For example, if a micro-frontend is implemented as a React.js component, then the micro-frontend can use
            React.js's built-in mechanism for receiving data from its container.
            On the other hand, how and if a React.js component can return a result to its container is an implementation
            detail that needs to be resolved on a case by case basis.
            This is because micro frontends are conceived as UI components rather than full-blown services.
          </li>
          <li id="nesting">
            <em>Nesting —</em>
            Micro frontends typically cannot be nested beyond 1 or 2 levels, because the allocated screen area becomes
            significantly smaller with each nesting level.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>2.3. Qworum</h3>
        <p>
          Qworum is a UI technology that was made specifically for microservices architectures.
          In contrast to micro frontends, which are parts of web pages,
          Qworum takes the web-API approach to user interaction.
        </p>
        <p id="interactive-service">
          In effect, Qworum defines a new type of web API where each end-point can receive data, interact with the
          end-user if needed, and then return a result. Note that Qworum services are not components embedded in web
          pages. Rather, they offer full-page UIs to end-users.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, in contrast to micro-frontend solutions where there are two types of entities (micro frontends and
          container applications), with Qworum everything is a Qworum service, including applications.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="ui-bottleneck-issue.svg" alt="With Qworum everything is a Qworum service, including applications">
          <figcaption>2.3.1: With Qworum everything is a Qworum service, including applications</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          So, while Qworum complements micro frontends rather than making them obsolete, by the same token Qworum does
          not have many of the limitations that micro frontends are burdened with:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>Bounding context —</em>
            Qworum is a web-scale microservices platform that is usable both within organizations and across
            organizations. Qworum is also independent from any particular application or web framework.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Data exchange —</em>
            Qworum defines a standard mechanism for exchanging data between Qworum services and their callers. This
            obviates the need for developing ad hoc data exchange solutions that are specific to a given application,
            framework or organization.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Nesting —</em>
            Qworum allows for unbounded nesting levels.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <h2>3. A platform for distributed web applications</h2>
      <p>
        There are currently two different Webs that exist on the World Wide Web:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The <dfn>Document Web</dfn>:
          This the Web that most Web developers will be familiar with.
          The primary type of content is the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML"
            target="_blank">HTML page</a>, and the primary content consumers are human users rather than machines.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <dfn>Semantic Web</dfn>:
          This the Web that is intended for machine consumption rather than human consumption.
          The primary type of content is <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/data" target="_blank">RDF</a>
          and its various encodings such as JSON-LD and Turtle.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Qworum adds another type of Web to the mix: the <dfn>Service Web</dfn>. Qworum is used for providing software
        rather than content. Qworum services are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Interactive</strong>: They can interact with end-users through HTML pages.</li>
        <li><strong>Composable</strong>: They can call other Qworum services, and even themselves. And Qworum services
          can return data to their callers. A <dfn>Qworum application</dfn>, on the other hand, is simply a Qworum
          service that does not have a caller.</li>
      </ul>

        <img src="the-three-webs.svg" alt="The three Webs">
        <figcaption>1: The three Webs</figcaption>

      <p>Note that although Qworum is distinct from the two previous Webs, it builds on them:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>User interaction occurs through HTML pages. End-users will barely notice that they are using Qworum rather
          than the Document Web.</li>
        <li>Qworum services can return semantic data to their callers, in addition to conventional data such as
          XML-wrapped JSON or any other XML data.</li>

      <h2>4. Demonstration — application spanning several DNS domains</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="/_assets/video/Qworum-demo-online-shop.mp4" target="_blank">This video</a>
        shows an online shop calling a remote shopping cart service.
      </p>
      <p>
        See this demo live at <a href="https://shop.demo.qworum.net" target="_blank">shop.demo.qworum.net</a>.
        Be sure to <a href="#downloads">install</a> the Qworum extension for your desktop browser beforehand.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this demonstration, the e-shop is a Qworum application and the shopping cart is a remote Qworum service.
        Thanks to Qworum, the shopping cart service integrates with the e-shop seamlessly, despite being hosted on
        another DNS domain. (The e-shop is hosted on <code>shop.demo.qworum.net</code> while the shopping cart is hosted
        on <code>cart.demo.qworum.net</code>)

        Note that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          with Qworum the user experience is similar to the current Web, with the exception that the browser's back
          button will be disabled.
        </li>
        <li>
          search engines can't peek inside Qworum services, so if search engine optimization (SEO) is important for you
          then you might want to carefully consider which parts of your application will be implemented as Qworum
          services. For enterprise and business applications SEO is generally not an issue, but consumer applications
          such as an online shop might want to only use remote Qworum services and limit the use of internal Qworum
          services to the parts that should remain out of reach for search engines.

      <h2>5. A secure computing environment</h2>
      <p>
        The Qworum platform conforms to the <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy" target="_blank">same-origin
          policy</a> that is the prevalent security mechanism for browser standards. In particular
        all phases of a given Qworum object are contained in the object's web origin. This ensures that data belonging
        to one web origin is unable to accidentally leak to another origin.
      </p>

    <section id="use-cases">
      <h2>6. Use cases</h2>
      <p>Qworum is broadly applicable for all web applications, whether it be an e-commerce application or an enterprise application.</p>

      <h2>7. Enabling Qworum for your domain</h2>
      <p>
        Enabling Qworum for your internet or intranet domain requires a subscription. Qworum subscriptions are available for purchase to companies and individuals worldwide.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pricing:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          400 USD per month or 4,000 USD per year. This covers up to 5 subdomains of the subscribed domain plus the subscribed domain itself.  (If your company's domain is <code>xyz.example</code> and a subscription is requested for <code>a.xyz.example</code>, then the subscription will cover websites hosted on domains such as <code>a.xyz.example</code>, <code>b.a.xyz.example</code> and <code>e.d.c.a.xyz.example</code>. Subscriptions cover the standard TCP ports for both the HTTPS and the HTTP protocols.)
        </li>
        <li>
          The number of subscribed subdomains can be increased for 80 USD per month per additional subdomain or 800 USD per year per additional subdomain.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Simply purchase your domain subscription by sending an email to <a href="mailto:info@qworum.net?subject=Domain+subscription">info@qworum.net</a>. Please make sure to include the following information:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Company name.
        </li>
        <li>
          Company address.
        </li>
        <li>
          Company's email address.
        </li>
        <li>
          Company's DNS domain or subdomain for which the domain subscription is being requested.
        </li>
        <li>
          The subscription renewal frequency (monthly or yearly).
        </li>
        <li>
          Optionally, the number of additional subdomains to be included in the subscription.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        You will receive an invoice by email. Your domain subscription will be activated within 7 workdays after payment (more precisely, 3 workdays + the time that Chrome Web Store takes for publishing the updated Qworum browser extension, which is generally less than 3 workdays). Your subscription period will start when the Qworum browser extension is enabled for your domain. You will get an email confirmation.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you'd like to try Qworum first, Qworum is FREE to use on your local machine. Please refer to the developer resources section.
