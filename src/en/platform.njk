  <h2>Qworum is the Service Web</h2>
  <p>
    There are currently two different Webs that exist on the World Wide Web:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The <dfn>Document Web</dfn>:
      This the Web that most Web developers will be familiar with.
      The primary type of content is the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML"
        target="_blank">HTML page</a>, and the primary content consumers are human users rather than machines.
    </li>
    <li>
      The <dfn>Semantic Web</dfn>:
      This the Web that is intended for machine consumption rather than human consumption.
      The primary type of content is <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/data" target="_blank">RDF</a>
      and its various encodings such as JSON-LD and Turtle.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Qworum adds another type of Web to the mix: the <dfn>Service Web</dfn>. Qworum is used for providing software
    rather than content. Qworum services are:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Interactive</strong>: They can interact with end-users through HTML pages.</li>
    <li><strong>Composable</strong>: They can call other Qworum services, and even themselves. And Qworum services
      can return data to their callers. A <dfn>Qworum application</dfn>, on the other hand, is simply a Qworum
      service that does not have a caller.</li>
  </ul>

  </figure>
  <p>Note that although Qworum is distinct from the two previous Webs, it builds on them:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>User interaction occurs through HTML pages. End-users will barely notice that they are using Qworum rather
      than the Document Web.</li>
    <li>Qworum services can return semantic data to their callers, in addition to conventional data such as
      XML-wrapped JSON or any other XML data.</li>
  </ul>

<section id="demo">
  <h2>Demonstration â€” application spanning several DNS domains</h2>
  <p>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSb1mqlFM4Y" target="_blank">This video</a>
    shows an online shop calling a remote shopping cart service.
  </p>
  <p>
    See this demo live at <a href="https://shop.demo.qworum.net" target="_blank">shop.demo.qworum.net</a>.
    Be sure to install the Qworum browser extension.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this demonstration, the e-shop is a Qworum application and the shopping cart is a remote Qworum service.
    Thanks to Qworum, the shopping cart service integrates with the e-shop seamlessly, despite being hosted on
    another DNS domain. (The e-shop is hosted on <code>shop.demo.qworum.net</code> while the shopping cart is hosted
    on <code>cart.demo.qworum.net</code>)

  </figure>
  <p>
    Note that:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      with Qworum the user experience is similar to the current Web, with the exception that the browser's back
      button will be disabled.
    </li>
    <li>
      search engines can't peek inside Qworum services, so if search engine optimization (SEO) is important for you
      then you might want to carefully consider which parts of your application will be implemented as Qworum
      services. For enterprise and business applications SEO is generally not an issue, but consumer applications
      such as an online shop might want to only use remote Qworum services and limit the use of internal Qworum
      services to the parts that should remain out of reach for search engines.
    </li>
  </ul>

<section id="security">
  <h2>A secure computing environment</h2>
  <p>
    The Qworum platform conforms to the <a
      href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy" target="_blank">same-origin
      policy</a> that is the prevalent security mechanism for browser standards. In particular
    all phases of a given Qworum object are contained in the object's web origin. This ensures that data belonging
    to one web origin is unable to accidentally leak to another origin.
