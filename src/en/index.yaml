    - title: Qworum upgrades the Web platform for application use cases
      description: >
        Today's Web is still fundamentally a content platform, despite JavaScript. 
        Qworum provides new browser features such as a script-based linking mechanism and a new in-browser session storage to enable advanced web applications that go much beyond what today's webapps and web APIs can.

        <a target='_blank' href='https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dogaarmangil_report-state-of-saas-integrations-2024-activity-7273076432229044224-i2wr'>A recent survey
        shows that application integration is <em>key</em> or <em>very important</em>
        for 84% of SaaS customers</a>. 
        Yet the REST protocol used by most SaaS is 25 years old at this point.
        Qworum's full-stack APIs are the most significant technological breakthrough in application integration
        in a ¼ of a century.
    - title: The most secure web API technology
      description: >
        Qworum is a breakthrough in web API security.

        Qworum is more secure than OAuth+REST</a>.
        In contrast to REST, the end-user stays in the loop during API calls, 
        and as a result applications cannot make API calls without the user's consent.
    - title: The UI layer for microservices
      description: Qworum removes the "UI-monolith" bottleneck for microservices architectures through distributed application frontends. Qworum is more generally applicable than microfrontends and complements them.
    - title: Native support for knowledge graph applications
      description: >
        RDF is natively supported as an alternative to JSON for representing data. 
        RDF brings semantic capabilities and is widely used in many knowledge-based industries
        such as pharma, health and biology, cosmetics, food, e-commerce, finance and banking, and the public sector.
    - title: New business opportunity in the B2B space
      description: Qworum APIs can be built by third parties on top of public SaaS APIs, and API subscriptions can be sold to SaaS customers and partners.

    - 0:00 Business use case.

    - 0:38 Demo — Application integration across 3 websites (project management application calls HCM application for adding members to a project).
    - 2:31 The 3 Webs.
#    - This is a 30-second demo showing how Qworum APIs can advantageously replace REST and GraphQL APIs. Here an e-commerce application calls the Qworum API of a remote shopping cart service.
#    - Note that the e-commerce application is implemented as a Qworum API as well. Non-Qworum web applications can also call Qworum APIs, although this demo does not show it.
#    - Also note how the end-user interacts with the shopping cart service directly, without going through the e-commerce application. This feature sets Qworum apart from REST, GraphQL and all other API types. Notably, this makes Qworum APIs the only ones able to support secure user authentication across all services, even for those involved in deep service dependency graphs.
