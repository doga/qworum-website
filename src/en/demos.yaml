  Here are some non-interactive integration tests for the Qworum browser extension.
  The source code is  <a href="https://github.com/doga/qworum-website/tree/master/src/demos" target="_blank">available on GitHub</a>.
  Note that these will only work on browsers that are Qworum-enabled.

demos:
- title: Endpoint call
  description: Calls a Qworum service endpoint which immediately returns a JSON result.
  link: /demos/call/1.qrm.xml
- title: Platform entitlements
  description: >
    A "platform entitlement" fault will be raised when an attempt is made to call a Qworum service endpoint that is hosted on a DNS domain that is outside of Qworum's Service Web.

- title: Platform faults
  description: >
    A "script" fault will be raised when the browser receives a Qworum script that contains a fault that is not service-specific.

- title: The goto instruction
  description: >
    A 2-phase service endpoint is called with a call argument in JSON format.
    The first call phase uses a goto instruction for redirecting the end-user to a second call phase that returns the call argument to the caller.
