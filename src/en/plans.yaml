  - ✤ For the user authentication service that is used for local testing, user data storage is guaranteed for 24 hours.
  - ✪ For the user authentication service that is used in production, user data storage is guaranteed for users who have logged in within the past 24 months.
  - Globally, there is one authentication service for use in production and one authentication service for local testing. Both are shared amongst all web applications.
