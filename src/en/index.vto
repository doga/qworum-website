mission:
  oneliner: |
    Category-defining 10x iPaaS for interactive processes. PaaS for composable services.
##    Best-in-class integrations are essential for today's leading business applications. Don't get left behind.
#    Category-defining iPaaS & PaaS. World-leading platform for interactive processes and distributed applications.
  usp:
  - Complex user-facing integrations that were unimaginable yesterday are now a breeze, and simpler integrations are 10x easier to implement.
  - Qworum is also an application platform that enables complex service orchestrations for composable/microservices/distributed architectures that are impossible without Qworum.
  - Qworum is an upgrade to the Web platform that offers a new type of web API and new advanced web browser capabilities.
#  - Qworum brings new advanced features to the Web platform for radically improved application support.
#  - Provide interactive full-stack Web APIs for 𝟭𝟬𝘅 𝗲𝗮𝘀𝗶𝗲𝗿 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗴𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 with 3rd-party applications as compared to REST & GraphQL.
#  - Qworum brings 𝗳𝘂𝗹𝗹-𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗸 𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗴𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 to the web platform. Integrate your interactive user flows into other applications, and vice versa. Increase the 𝗯𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝘃𝗮𝗹𝘂𝗲 of your applications.
#  - Modularise the frontend of your web applications for improved developer productivity and full compatibility with microservices architectures.
#  - Make your application frontends compatible with 𝗺𝗶𝗰𝗿𝗼𝘀𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗰𝗲𝘀 𝗮𝗿𝗰𝗵𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲𝘀. Enable developer teams to work in parallel by spreading frontends over several web origins.
#  - Qworum defines 𝗮 𝗻𝗲𝘄 𝘁𝘆𝗽𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝘄𝗲𝗯 𝗔𝗣𝗜 where each endpoint can interact with the end-user ("full-stack").

integrations:
  title: How Qworum improves application integrations
  description:
    - Qworum integrations are interactive, whereas the currently prevalent application integrations consist of non-interactive data transfers. This makes Qworum the easier API technology to use in many scenarios.
    - For example, 𝗤𝘄𝗼𝗿𝘂𝗺 𝗔𝗣𝗜𝘀 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝘃𝗶𝗱𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗶𝗿 𝗼𝘄𝗻 𝗨𝗜𝘀 so that these UIs don't need to be implemented by each client application separately.
    - Also, calling Qworum APIs typically require a 𝘀𝗺𝗮𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗿 𝗻𝘂𝗺𝗯𝗲𝗿 𝗼𝗳 𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘀 compared to other APIs. Think about what it takes to browse a remote file system for example.
    - In addition, Qworum integrations are easier to set up. For the client applications, there is 𝗻𝗼 𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗱 𝘁𝗼 𝗼𝗯𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗻 𝗮𝗻 𝗔𝗣𝗜 𝗸𝗲𝘆, because Qworum API calls are reguler web redirections. Also, there is 𝗻𝗼 𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗱 𝘁𝗼 𝗮𝘂𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘂𝘀𝗲𝗿 to the remote service, as Qworum APIs will take care of authenticating the users themselves.
    - And lastly, Qworum integrations produce 𝗹𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗮, not stale data.

demo:
  title: See a Qworum-based web application in action
  description: >
    Here is a 30-second demo showing an e-shop that uses a remote shopping cart hosted on a different DNS domain.
    <a target="_blank" href='https://www.infoq.com/articles/qworum-modular-ui-architecture/'>This InfoQ article</a> describes in detail how this works.
    Note that consumer SaaS would ideally require that Qworum come preinstalled on browsers, which is currently not the case.

fullstack:
  title: What is a full-stack API protocol?
  description:
    - Full-stack API protocols cover all three application layers — data, business logic, and presentation. 𝗤𝘄𝗼𝗿𝘂𝗺 𝗶𝘀 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗿𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗹𝘆 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗼𝗻𝗹𝘆 𝗳𝘂𝗹𝗹-𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗸 𝗔𝗣𝗜 𝘁𝗲𝗰𝗵𝗻𝗼𝗹𝗼𝗴𝘆 in existence.
    - The biggest difference between Qworum and the other protocols is that Qworum structures and modularises application frontends, whereas the others are backend protocols.
    - In that sense, Qworum does not replace the other protocols, but complements them. For example, a Qworum endpoint may very well use REST for connecting to the service's backend. 
    - It is also worth noting that Qworum is not only a protocol that web applications use for calling remote services, but 𝘄𝗵𝗼𝗹𝗲 𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗳𝗿𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗻𝗱𝘀 𝗰𝗮𝗻 𝗯𝗲 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝘁 𝗳𝗿𝗼𝗺 𝘀𝗰𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗰𝗵 𝗮𝘀 𝗤𝘄𝗼𝗿𝘂𝗺 𝗔𝗣𝗜𝘀, and in fact this is the recommended way of structuring web applications. In this case, a web application will have a main Qworum endpoint, plus any number of local and remote endpoints that the application may call.
    - Another difference between Qworum and the other protocols is that Qworum sessions are stateful. This means that Qworum attaches runtime states to browser tabs.
