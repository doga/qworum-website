  Subscribed subdomains can have arbitrary depth.
  If your company's domain is <code>xyz.example</code> and you have requested a subscription for <code>a.xyz.example</code>, then the subscription will cover websites hosted on domains such as <code>a.xyz.example</code>, <code>b.a.xyz.example</code> and <code>e.d.c.a.xyz.example</code>. The standard TCP ports for HTTPS and HTTP protocols are both supported.
