The primary type of content is the <a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML target=_blank>HTML page</a>, and the primary content consumers are human users rather than machines.<li>The <dfn>Semantic Web</dfn>: This the Web that is intended for machine consumption rather than human consumption. The primary type of content is <a href=https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/data target=_blank>RDF</a>, which can be represented using many different but equivalent data formats such as JSON-LD and N-Quads.</ul><p>Qworum adds another type of Web to the mix: the <dfn>Service Web</dfn>. Qworum is used for providing applications rather than content.<figure><img alt="The three Webs"src=/assets/images/platform/the-three-webs.svg><figcaption>Figure 1: The three Webs</figcaption></figure><p>Qworum services are:<ul><li><strong>Interactive</strong>: They can interact with end-users through HTML pages.<li><strong>Composable</strong>: They can call, and be called by, other Qworum services. A <dfn>Qworum application</dfn> is simply a special service endpoint that is supposed to run indefinitely, and does not normally receive or return data.</ul><p>Note that Qworum is conceived as a superset of the Document Web. Although Qworum does not encompass the Semantic Web directly, it allows the use of semantic data as input & output for Qworum APIs, and for storing session data.<figure><img alt="User flow"src=/assets/images/platform/user-flow.png style=width:400px;height:auto><figcaption>Figure 2: The user flow when a Qworum application or service calls another Qworum service</figcaption></figure></section><section id=fullstack-api><h2>What is a full-stack API protocol?</h2><p>Full-stack API protocols cover all three application layers — data, business logic, and presentation.

For example, a Qworum endpoint may very well use REST for connecting to the service's backend.<p>It is also worth noting that Qworum is not only a protocol that web applications use for calling remote services, but 𝘄𝗵𝗼𝗹𝗲 𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗳𝗿𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗻𝗱𝘀 𝗰𝗮𝗻 𝗯𝗲 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝘁 𝗳𝗿𝗼𝗺 𝘀𝗰𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗰𝗵 𝗮𝘀 𝗤𝘄𝗼𝗿𝘂𝗺 𝗔𝗣𝗜𝘀, and in fact this is the recommended way of structuring web applications. In this case, a web application will have a main Qworum endpoint, plus any number of local and remote endpoints that the application may call.<p>Another difference between Qworum and the other protocols is that Qworum sessions are stateful. This means that Qworum attaches runtime states to browser tabs.<figure><img alt="The application layer coverage of API protocols"src=/assets/images/platform/qworum-vs-other-protocols.svg></figure></section><section id=security><h2>A secure computing environment</h2><p>The Qworum platform conforms to the <a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy target=_blank>same-origin policy</a> that is the prevalent security mechanism for browser standards. In particular all phases of a given Qworum object are contained in the object's web origin. This ensures that data belonging to one web origin is unable to accidentally leak to another origin.</section></main><footer><span class=footer-company> © <time datetime=2024> 2024 </time> Doğa Armangil </span> • <span> <a href=/docs/legal/terms-of-service/ target=_blank> Terms of service </a> • <a href=/docs/legal/privacy-policy/ target=_blank> Privacy policy </a> </span><br><br><span class=footer-hattip> Static site generated with <a href=https://lume.land target=_blank>Lume</a>. </span></footer>
