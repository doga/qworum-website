Introduction</h2><p>The World Wide Web <a href=#ref-www>♦︎</a> was initially conceived as a decentralised information system consisting of interlinked documents, yet its potential as a platform for applications soon became apparent. The ongoing effort that has been undertaken by the ICT community since the Web's early days in order to better support Web applications has sofar produced various client-side and server-side upgrades to the initial Web, such as JavaScript and application servers.<p>Yet there is room for improvement, particularly regarding the decentralisation of the front-ends of Web applications. In today's Web, an application is contained within a single Web <dfn>origin</dfn> (example: https://example.com) <a href=#ref-origin>♦︎</a>, and frequently even within a single Web page. This limits the amount of functionality that can be shared amongst application developer teams, and results in considerable duplication of effort. (One notable exception to this picture is OAuth-based services which can be called remotely by applications.)<p>Qworum enables new gains in productivity for the software community by making it possible to build Web applications that are composed of interactive services ("Qworum services") that are hosted anywhere on the Web and that are callable remotely.<p>It is worth noting that Qworum services are of practical use even if the caller of a service has the same Web origin as the called service. This is because Qworum services can be inserted in any user flow without disrupting it, similarly to functions in conventional programming. For example, with Qworum an application no longer needs to pass a return path to the login dialog when it requires the end-user to sign in before accessing a restricted page. Again, this is similar to conventional programming where a function does not know how the execution proceeds when its own execution finishes.<p>As a foretaste, here is how an e-commerce site might call a remote shopping cart service:<figure><pre><code class="language-xml hljs">

The topmost call frame pertains to the call currently being executed; the remaining call frames contain the states of calls whose executions are currently suspended. Call frames are used for storing call states in the form of <a href=#data>data</a>s (which point to data) and <a href=#object>object</a>s.<li>A <dfn id=main-object>main <a href=#object>object</a></dfn> that is attached to the browser tab. The main object is the owner of the first call frame in the call stack.</ul><p>A regular browsing session on the World Wide Web can be thought of as a multi-phase service call that doesn't use the Qworum-related functionality that the user agent provides (except that browsing different Web origins within the same browser tab does not raise an <code>* origin</code> <a href=#fault>fault</a>). In particular:<ul><li>regular Web browsing happens within the bounds of the first call frame in the call stack, and<li>the main object remains unused during a regular Web browsing session.</ul><figure><img alt src=/assets/images/specification/v1/figure-2.7.svg><figcaption>Figure 2.7.1: The execution state of a browser tab.</figcaption></figure></section><section id=object><h3>2.8. <dfn>Qworum Object</dfn></h3><p>In conventional object-oriented programming, objects are used for storing state that is shared between multiple calls to one or more functions, which are the object's methods. Qworum is porting this concept into the Web environment in the form of Qworum objects.<p>A Qworum object, then, is a container for run-time state that is shared between different calls. Qworum objects are used for storing <a href=#data>data</a>s (which point to data) and other Qworum objects.<p>Qworum objects are needed for storing the states of services such as shopping carts that must remember their contents across different calls incoming from an e-commerce site for example. In the absence of Qworum objects, Qworum would only be able to support services where each incoming call is independent from one another, which is the case for user authentication services and payment processing services among others.<p>Here is how Qworum objects are used in practice:<ul><li>Each multi-phase call has a Qworum object that is the owner of the call. When initiating a call, the call's owner object is created by the user agent if it does not already exist in the browser tab's execution state.<li>Each Qworum object has a Web origin which is determined when the object is first used as the owner of a call. All phases of all calls which are owned by a Qworum object must have the object's origin, otherwise an <code>* origin</code> <a href=#fault>fault</a> will be raised during run-time.<li>Qworum objects can be stored in call frames, or as the main object of an execution state.</ul><figure><img alt src=/assets/images/specification/v1/figure-2.8.svg><figcaption>Figure 2.8.1: The Qworum object.</figcaption></figure></section><section id=class><h3>2.9. <dfn>Qworum Class</dfn></h3><p>Qworum does not mandate that all Qworum objects stored in an execution state have different origins. It follows that calls to the same URL can be made using different owner objects, even within the same browser tab. This is how the concept of Qworum classes emerges; not as a browser feature, but rather as an aid for designing Qworum-based applications and services.<p>Formally, we can define Qworum objects to be instances of Qworum classes, and also that each Web origin can host any number of Qworum classes.<figure><img alt src=/assets/images/specification/v1/figure-2.9.svg><figcaption>Figure 2.9.1: Qworum classes and objects.</figcaption></figure><p>Going back to our shopping cart example, we can imagine an e-commerce site that allows its users to create several shopping carts on the same shopping cart service, for example one "Home" cart, one "Work" cart and one "New year's eve party" cart.</section></section><section id=instructions><h2>3. Instructions</h2><p>This section lists the instructions that are available to <a href=#script>Qworum script</a>s.

The current call has read/write access to data in the following locations:<ul><li>the current call frame,<li>the current call's owner object,<li>nested objects contained in the current call's owner object.</ul><p>The location of the data container that is being accessed is determined by <code>data</code>'s mandatory <code>path</code> attribute. This attribute's value is a JSON-encoded array of strings. In these strings, the leading and trailing whitespace characters are ignored.<p id=reserved-path-prefixes>Within this array, some strings are treated differently by the user agent:<ul><li>any string that starts with <code>@</code> denotes the current call's owner object, and<li>strings starting with <code>$</code>, <code>#</code> or <code>🤖</code> are reserved and should not be used at this time.</ul><h4>3.1.1.
